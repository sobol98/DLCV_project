TASK
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8  (16GB data)
Type: Image classification

Task list:

6. ~~Download the competition dataset.~~
7. ~~Read about existing solutions (e. g. challenge discussions).~~
8. ~~Download one of the existing solutions or implement your own some simple solution as your baseline.~~
    - get full test data
10. Improve, extend and optimize the solution using the time you have available for the laboratory classes.
11. Evaluate your solutions against the competitions leaderboard or results presented for given dataset in research papers.
12. Prepare presentation of your solution. It should be 10 minutes long and optimally should include the following information:
    - Description of the investigated task, including the metric to be optimized and the dataset
    - Description of the approach used by your group
    - Implemented modifications and upgrades, along with their impact on the solution (including modifications that did not improve results)
    - Comparison of your results to other solutions, challenge leaderboard or scientific papers (even if the achieved results are far worse)
    - Descriptions of top performing solutions that were published (e.g. in Kaggle discussions after the competition had ended, or in scientific papers)
  
13. Laboratory grade will depend on the amount of effort you put in modifying your solution:
    - for baseline solution without modifications – you will score 25/50 pts
    - for typical modifications: tuned hyperparameters, switched backbone, image augmentation added – you will score around 35-40/50 pts
    - for other, but reasonable modifications, that can be learned from kaggle discussions or research  papers – you will score around 50/50 pts. One such modification is enough. The modifications that do not improve the results still count (as long as they are reasonable).
